## Please fill in your project documentation in this README.md file 

Refer to [README](docs/source/index.rst#section-quickstart) for a quickstart of how to use caravel_user_project

Refer to [README](docs/source/index.rst) for this sample project documentation. 
For this sample project, we went for the first option where the user macro is hardened first, then it is inserted in the user project wrapper without having any standard cells on the top level.
